# ESP32-S USB Dongle Solution

## 1.Overview

This example shows how to set up ESP32-S chip to work as a USB Dongle Device.

Supports the following functions:

* Support Host to surf the Internet wirelessly via USB
* Support Host to communicate and control ESP32-S series devices via USB
* Support multiple system、Wi-Fi control commands
* Support hot swap

## 2.How to use example

### 2.1 Hardware Required

Any ESP boards that have USB-OTG supported.

* ESP32-S2

* ESP32-S3

### 2.2 Common Pin Assignments

Pin assignment is only needed for ESP chips that have an USB-OTG peripheral. If your board doesn't have a USB connector connected to the USB-OTG dedicated GPIOs, you may have to DIY a cable and connect **D+** and **D-** to the pins listed below.

```
ESP BOARD          USB CONNECTOR (type A)
                          --
                         | || VCC
[USBPHY_DM_NUM]  ------> | || D-
[USBPHY_DP_NUM]  ------> | || D+
                         | || GND
                          --
```

Refer to `soc/usb_pins.h` to find the real GPIO number of **USBPHY_DP_NUM** and **USBPHY_DM_NUM**.

|             | USB_DP | USB_DM |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| ESP32-S2/S3 | GPIO20 | GPIO19 |

### 2.3 Build and Flash

* Confirm that the ESP-IDF environment is successfully set up
* To add ESP-IDF environment variables, the Linux method is as follows. For other platforms, please refer to [Set up the environment variables](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index .html#step-4-set-up-the-environment-variables)

    ```
    . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
    ```

* Set the compilation target to `esp32s2` or `esp32s3`

    ```
    idf.py set-target esp32s2
    ```

* build、flash、monitor

    ```
    idf.py -p (PORT) build flash monitor
    ```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type `Ctrl-]`.)



After the system is running, Linux will add a USB Ethernet device and a USB ACM device.

view the USB Ethernet device through th e following command

```
ifconfig -a
```

<img src=".\_static\ifconfig.png" alt="ifconfig" style="zoom: 80%;" />

view the USB ACM device through the following command

```
ls /dev/tty*
```

You can communicate with the development board through the USB ACM port.

view the currently supported commands and usage through the help command.

## 3.Way of distribution network

You can choose any of the following methods to configure the network

### 1. Use the `sta` command to directly connect to the corresponding AP

**Example**

```
sta <ssid> [<password>]
```

**Notes**

* `password` is optional

* When the USB Dongle network is switched, the network device needs to be reloaded

    >ifconfig                           //find USB Ethernet name
    >
    >ifconfig ethxxx down 
    >
    >ifconfig ethxxx up    

### 2. smartconfig network configuration

(1) Hardware Required

Download ESPTOUCH APP from app store: [Android source code](https://github.com/EspressifApp/EsptouchForAndroid) [iOS source code](https://github.com/EspressifApp/EsptouchForIOS) is available.

(2) Make sure your phone connect to the target AP (2.4GHz).

(3) Open ESPTOUCH app and input password.

(4) Send commands via USB ACM port

**Example**

```
startsmart
```

**Notes**

* When the USB Dongle network is switched, the network device needs to be reloaded

    >ifconfig                           //find USB Ethernet name
    >
    >ifconfig ethxxx down 
    >
    >ifconfig ethxxx up
